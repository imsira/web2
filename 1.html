<h2>영어란 무엇인가 ? English language</h2>
<p><strong> <u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English"
  target="_blank" title="영어의 정의">English</a></u>  is a West Germanic language </strong> that was first spoken in early medieval
   England and eventually became a global lingua
    franca.[5][6] It is named after the Angles
    , one of the Germanic tribes that migrated
     to the area of Great Britain that later
      took their name, as England. Both names
       derive from Anglia, a peninsula in the
       Baltic Sea. The language is closely related
       to Frisian and Low Saxon, and its vocabulary
        has been significantly influenced by other
        Germanic languages, particularly Norse
        (a North Germanic language), and to a greater
         extent by Latin and French.<br><br><br>

   English has developed over the course
    of more than 1,400 years. The earliest
     forms of English, a group of West Germanic
      (Ingvaeonic) dialects brought to Great
       Britain by Anglo-Saxon settlers in the
        5th century, are collectively called Old
         English.
